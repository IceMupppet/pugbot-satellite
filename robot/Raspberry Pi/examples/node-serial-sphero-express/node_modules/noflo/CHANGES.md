NoFlo ChangeLog
===============

## 0.5.11 (October 23rd 2014)

* On Node.js ComponentLoader `setSource` now loads components virtually from `<baseDir>/components` to support relative module loading
* Subgraphs don't get unattached ports implicitly exported any longer. Register in/outports in the graph to make them available from the outside
* Added safeties for restarted networks to WirePattern

## 0.5.10 (October 23rd 2014)

* Port names are now validated to only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters or underscores
* `ComponentLoader.load` method now calls its callback with the Node.js style `error, instance` signature to allow catching component loading issues
* Graph merging support via the graph journal
* `getSource` now returns correct type for graphs
* Subgraph networks are started when the main network starts, instead of automatically on their own timing. As a fallback they will also start when any of their ports receives a `connect`
* Networks can now be stopped and restarted at will using the `stop` and `start` methods
* The running state of a NoFlo network can be now queried with the `isRunning` method
* NoFlo networks support FBP protocol debugging via the `setDebug` and `getDebug` methods
* `Ports.add` is now chainable
* The `start` port was removed from subgraphs

These changes mean that in situations where a subgraph is used standalone without a network around it, you need to call `component.start()` manually. This is typical especially in unit tests.

## 0.5.9 (August 5th 2014)

* Hotfix reverting backwards-incompatible changes in subgraph loading, see [#229](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/issues/229).

## 0.5.8 (August 4th 2014)

* Fixed several issues in connections and data synchronization
* Updated `read-installed` to the latest version
* Updated JSON Schema for NoFlo graph definition format
* Low-level functions to add and remove graph inports at run-time, see [#242](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/pull/242)
* Fixes for default port values and IIPs in subgraphs.
* Added `dropInput` option for WirePattern to drop premature data while parameters not yet received. See [#239](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/issues/239)
* Addressable ports support in WirePattern. See [details](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/issues/240#issuecomment-51094257).

## 0.5.7 (July 23rd 2014)

* Ports now default to *not required*. Set the port option `required: true` the port needs to be connected in order for the component to work
* `MultiError` pattern is enabled by default when using `WirePattern` and supports `forwardGroups` option for error packets.
* `WirePattern` components now deal more consistently with groups and disconnect events

## 0.5.6 (June 23rd 2014)

* Custom icon support for subgraphs via the `icon` key in graph properties
* Parameter support for `WirePattern` components, allowing them to have configuration parameters that need to be set only once. Example:

```coffeescript
component = new noflo.Component
component.inPorts.add 'path',
  datatype: 'string'
  required: true
component.inPorts.add 'delay',
  datatype: 'int'
  required: false
component.inPorts.add 'line',
  datatype: 'string'
component.inPorts.add 'repeat',
  datatype: 'int'
component.outPorts.add 'out',
  datatype: 'object'
component.outPorts.add 'error',
  datatype: 'object'

noflo.helpers.WirePattern component,
  in: ['line', 'repeat']
  out: 'out'
  params: ['path', 'delay']
  async: true
, (data, groups, out, callback) ->
  path = component.params.path
  delay = if component.params.delay then component.params.delay else 0
  doSomeThing path, delay, data.line, data.repeat, (err, res) ->
    return callback err if err
    out.send res
    callback()
```

## 0.5.5 (June 20th 2014)

* Fixed an issue with `StreamSender` affecting WirePattern components dealing with multiple levels of grouping
* New `CustomizeError` helper for passing information with Error objects in NoFlo. For example:

```coffeescript
# Instantiate an error object
err = new Error 'Something went wrong'

# Add metadata to it. Usually this should include groups and other machine-readable information
noflo.helpers.CustomizeError err,
  groups: groups
  foo: 'bar'

# Send it to error port
c.error err
```

## 0.5.4 (June 11th 2014)

* The new [noflo-api-updater](https://www.npmjs.org/package/noflo-api-updater) tool assists in updating components to the latest NoFlo API
* `GroupedInput` helper has been renamed to `WirePattern` due to a bigger collection of synchronization options.
* The `WirePattern` helper has a new `ordered` option for choosing whether the output should be in same order as the incoming packets
* Options `group` and `forwardGroups` of `WirePattern` are made independent, so make sure to use `forwardGroups: true` if you need this feature together with `group: true`.
* Added support for multiple outputs and reading/writing substreams as solid objects in `WirePattern`.
* Added `load` outport handing in `WirePattern` to make it a complete replacement for `AsyncComponent`.
* Added helpers for advanced error handling, see [#185](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/issues/185).
* Added `caching` option for OutPorts that makes them re-send their latest value to any newly-added connections, see [#151](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/issues/151) for example use cases.

## 0.5.3 (May 31st 2014)

* `integer` is accepted as an alias for the `int` datatype for ports
* `buffer` is now an accepted port datatype
* The Continuous Integration setup for NoFlo now runs on both [Linux](https://travis-ci.org/noflo/noflo) and [Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bergie/noflo)
* Fixed a bug with ComponentLoader `getSource` method when invoked early on in execution
* New component helpers for easier authoring

The `MapComponent` helper is usable for synchronous components that operate on a single inport-outport combination:

```coffeescript
c = new noflo.Component
  inPorts:
    in:
      datatype: 'number'
  outPorts:
    out:
      datatype: 'number'
noflo.helpers.MapComponent c, (data, groups, out) ->
  out.send data * 2
```

The `GroupedInput` helper assists in building components that need to synchronize multiple inputs by groups:

```coffeescript
c = new noflo.Component
  inPorts:
    x:
      datatype: 'number'
    y:
      datatype: 'number'
  outPorts:
    radius:
      datatype: 'number'

noflo.helpers.GroupedInput c,
  in: ['x', 'y']
  out: 'radius'
, (data, groups, out) ->
  out.send Math.sqrt(data.x**2 + data.y**2)
```

`GroupedInput` can also synchronize via specific fields of object-type packets:

```coffeescript
helpers.GroupedInput c,
  in: ['user', 'message']
  out: 'signedMessage'
  field: 'request'
, (data, groups, out) ->
  out.send
    request: data.request
    user: data.user.name
    text: data.message.text

user.send {request: 123, id: 42, name: 'John'}
message.send {request: 123, id: 17, text: 'Hello world'}

# Result:
{ request: 123, user: 'John', text: 'Hello world'}
```

## 0.5.2 (May 8th 2014)

* Fixed a minor packaging issue

## 0.5.1 (May 8th 2014)

* Custom component loaders can be registered programmatically using the `registerLoader` method of NoFlo's ComponentLoader
* `contains` method for buffered inports returns the number of data packets the buffer has
* [Call stack exhaustion](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/issues/156) on very large graphs has been fixed
* The `error` outport of AsyncComponents now sends the group information of the original input together with the error
* The `error` method of regular ports can now also handle groups as a second parameter
* Ports can now list their attached sockets (by array index) via the `listAttached` method
* `function` is now an accepted datatype for ports
* There is now initial support for making connections to and from *addressable* ports with a specified index

In the FBP format, these can be specified with the bracket syntax:

```fbp
SomeNode OUT[2] -> IN OtherNode
'foo' -> OPTS[1] OtherNode
```

In the JSON file these are defined in connections by adding a integer to the `index` key of the `src` or `tgt` definition.

The NoFlo Graph class provides these with the following methods:

```
addEdgeIndex(str outNode, str outPort, int outIndex, str inNode, str inPort, int inIndex, obj metadata)
addInitiaIndex(mixed data, str inNode, str inPort, int inIndex, obj metadata)
```

If indexes are not specified, the fall-back behavior is to automatically index the connections based on next available slot in the port.

## 0.5.0 (March 28th 2014)

* Support for setting the default `baseDir` of Node.js NoFlo environment with `NOFLO_PROJECT_ROOT` env var (defaults to current working directory)
* Support for loading graph definitions via AJAX on browser-based NoFlo
* Support for delayed initialization of Subgraph components via ComponentLoader
* Component instances now get the node's metadata passed to the `getComponent` function
* New methods for manipulating Graph metadata:
  - `setProperties`
  - `setInportMetadata`
  - `setOutportMetadata`
  - `setGroupMetadata`
  - `setNodeMetadata`
  - `setEdgeMetadata`
* Graph exports can now be renamed, and emit `addExport`, `removeExport`, and `renameExport` events
* New Graph transaction API for grouping graph changes. Transactions can be observed
  - `startTransaction`
  - `endTransaction`
* New Journal class, for following Graph changes and restoring earlier revisions. Currently supports `undo` and `redo`
* [New port API](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/issues/136) allowing better addressability and metadata
* Graph's published ports are now declared in two separate `inports` and `outports` arrays to [reduce ambiguity](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/issues/118)

With the new API component ports can be declared with:

```coffeescript
@inPorts = new noflo.InPorts
@inPorts.add 'in', new noflo.InPort
  datatype: 'object'
  type: 'http://schema.org/Person'
  description: 'Persons to be processed'
  required: true
  buffered: true
```

The `noflo.Ports` objects emit `add` and `remove` events when ports change. They also support passing port information as options:

```coffeescript
@outPorts = new noflo.OutPorts
  out: new noflo.OutPort
    datatype: 'object'
    type: 'http://schema.org/Person'
    description: 'Processed person objects'
    required: true
    addressable: true
```

The input ports also allow passing in an optional *processing function* that gets called on information packets events.

* [New component API](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/issues/97) allowing simpler component definition in both CoffeeScript and JavaScript:

```js
var noflo = require('noflo');

exports.getComponent = function() {
  var c = new noflo.Component();

  c.inPorts.add('in', function(event, payload) {
    if (packet.event !== 'data')
      return;
    // Do something with the packet, then
    c.outPorts.out.send(packet.data);
  });

  c.outPorts.add('out');

  return c;
};
```

* Support for dealing with component source code via ComponentLoader `setSource` and `getSource` methods

## 0.4.4 (February 4th 2014)

* Support for CoffeeScript 1.7.x on Node.js

## 0.4.3 (December 6th 2013)

* ArrayPorts with attached sockets now return `true` for `isAttached` checks. There is a separate `canAttach` method for checking whether more can be added
* Icon support was added for both libraries and components using the set from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/)
  - For libraries, register via the `noflo.icon` key in your `package.json` (Node.js libraries) or `component.json` (browser libraries)
  - For components, provide via the `icon` attribute
* Subgraphs now support closing their internal NoFlo network via the `shutdown` method
* Component Loader is able to load arbitrary graphs outside of the normal package manifest registration via the `loadGraph` method
* Component Loader of the main NoFlo network is now carried across subgraphs instead of instantiating locally
* Libraries can provide a custom loader for their components by registering a `noflo.loader` key in the manifest pointing to a CommonJS module
* Exported ports can now contain metadata
* It is possible to create named groups of nodes in a NoFlo graph, which can be useful for visual editors
* Components have an `error` helper method for sending errors to the `error` outport, or throwing them if that isn't attached

## 0.4.2 (September 28th 2013)

* Easier debugging: port errors now contain the name of the NoFlo graph node and the port

## 0.4.1 (September 25th 2013)

* NoFlo components can now implement a `shutdown` method which is called when they're removed from a network
* Graphs can contain additional metadata in the `properties` key
* NoFlo networks have now a `start` and a `stop` method for starting and stopping execution

## 0.4.0 (July 31st 2013)

Browser support:

* The NoFlo engine has been made available client-side via the [Component](https://github.com/component/component) system
* New BDD tests written with [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) that can be run on both browser and server

Changes to components:

* All components have been moved to [various component libraries](http://noflojs.org/library/)

Development tools:

* [Grunt scaffold](https://github.com/bergie/grunt-init-noflo) for easily creating NoFlo component packages including cross-platform test automation

File format support:

* NoFlo's internal FBP parser was removed in favor of the [fbp](https://github.com/noflo/fbp) package
* The `display` property of nodes in the [JSON format](https://github.com/bergie/noflo#noflo-graph-file-format) was removed in favor of the more flexible `metadata` object

Internals:

* Support for renaming nodes in a NoFlo graph via the `renameNode` method
* Adding IIPs to a graph will now emit a `addInitial` event instead of an `addEdge` event
* Graph's `removeEdge` method allows specifying both ends of the connection to prevent ambiguity
* IIPs can now be removed using the `removeInitial` method, which fires a `removeInitial` event instead of `removeEdge`
* NoFlo Networks now support delayed starting
* The `isBrowser` method on the main NoFlo interface tells whether NoFlo is running under browser or Node.js
* Support for running under Node.js on Windows

## 0.3.4 (July 5th 2013)

Internals:

* New `LoggingComponent` base class for component libraries

## 0.3.3 (April 9th 2013)

Development:

* Build process was switched from Cake to [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* NoFlo is no longer tested against Node.js 0.6

## 0.3.2 (April 9th 2013)

NoFlo internals:

* Ports now support optional type information, allowing editors to visualize compatible port types

  ``` coffeescript
  @inPorts =
    in: new noflo.ArrayPort 'object'
    times: new noflo.Port 'int'
  @outPorts =
    out: new noflo.Port 'string'
  ```

* NoFlo ComponentLoader is now able to register new components and graphs and update package.json files accordingly

  ``` coffeescript
  loader = new noflo.ComponentLoader __dirname
  loader.registerComponent 'myproject', 'SayHello', './components/SayHello.json', (err) ->
    console.error err if err
  ```

New libraries:

* [noflo-test](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-test) provides a framework for testing NoFlo components

## 0.3.1 (February 13th 2013)

NoFlo internals:

* The NoFlo `.fbp` parser now [guards against recursion](https://github.com/bergie/noflo/pull/57) on inline subgraphs
* NoFlo subgraphs now inherit the directory context for component loading from the NoFlo process that loaded them
* Exported ports in NoFlo graphs are now supported also in NoFlo-generated JSON files
* Nodes in NoFlo graphs can now contain additional metadata to be used for visualization purposes. For example, in FBP format graphs:

  ``` fbp
  Read(ReadFile:foo) OUT -> IN Display(Output:foo)
  ```

  will cause both the _Read_ and the _Display_ node to contain a `metadata.routes` field with an array containing `foo`. Multiple routes can be specified by separating them with commas

New component libraries:

* [noflo-filesystem](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-filesystem) provides advanced file system components
* [noflo-github](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-github) provides components for interacting with the GitHub service
* [noflo-git](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-git) provides components for Git revision control system
* [noflo-oembed](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-oembed) provides oEmbed protocol support
* [noflo-redis](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-redis) provides Redis database components

## 0.3.0 (December 19th 2012)

User interface:

* NoFlo's web-based user interface has been moved to a separate [noflo-ui](https://github.com/bergie/noflo-ui) repository
* The `noflo` shell command now uses `STDOUT` for debug output (when invoked with `--debug`) instead of `STDERR`
  - Events from subgraphs are also visible when the `noflo` command is used with the additional `-s` switch
  - Contents of packets are shown when the `noflo` command is used with the additional `-v` switch
  - Shell debug output is no colorized for easier reading
* [DOT language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_language) output from NoFlo was made more comprehensive
* NoFlo graphs can now alias their internal ports to more user-friendly names when used as subgraphs. When aliases are used, the other free ports are not exposed via the _Graph_ component. This works in both FBP and JSON formats:

  For FBP format graphs:

  ``` fbp
  EXPORT=INTERNALPROCESS.PORT:EXTERNALPORT
  ```

  For JSON format graphs:

  ``` json
  {
    "exports": [
      {
        "private": "INTERNALPROCESS.PORT",
        "public": "EXTERNALPORT"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

NoFlo internals:

* All code was migrated from 4 spaces to 2 space indentation as recommended by [CoffeeScript style guide](https://github.com/polarmobile/coffeescript-style-guide). Our CI environment safeguards this via [CoffeeLint](http://www.coffeelint.org/)
* Events emitted by ArrayPorts now contain the socket number as a second parameter
* Initial Information Packet sending was delayed by `process.nextTick` to ensure possible subgraphs are ready
* The `debug` flag was removed from NoFlo _Network_ class, and the networks were made EventEmitters for more flexible monitoring
* The `isSubgraph` method tells whether a _Component_ is a subgraph or a regular code component
* Subgraphs loaded directly by _ComponentLoader_ no longer expose their `graph` port
* The `addX` methods of _Graph_ now return the object that was added to the graph
* NoFlo networks now emit `start` and `end` events
* Component instances have the ID of the node available at the `nodeId` property
* Empty strings and other falsy values are now allowed as contents of Initial Information Packets

Changes to core components:

* _ReadGroup_ now sends the group to a `group` outport, and original packet to `out` port
* _GetObjectKey_ can now send packets that don't contain the specified key to a `missed` port instead of dropping them
* _SetPropertyValue_ provides the group hierarchy received via its `in` port when sending packets out
* _Kick_ can now optionally send out the packet it received via its `data` port when receiving a disconnect on the `in` port. Its `out` port is now an ArrayPort
* _Concat_ only clears its buffers on disconnect when all inports have connected at least once
* _SplitStr_ accepts both regular expressions (starting and ending with a `/`) and strings for splitting
* _ReadDir_ and _Stat_ are now AsyncComponents that can be throttled

New core components:

* _MakeDir_ creates a directory at a given path
* _DirName_ sends the directory name for a given file path
* _CopyFile_ copies the file behind the path received via the `source` port to the path received via the `destination` port
* _FilterPacket_ allows filtering packets by regular expressions sent to the `regexp` port. Non-matching packets are sent to the `missed` port
* _FirstGroup_ allows you to limit group hierarchies of packets to a single level
* _LastPacket_ sends the last packet it received when getting a disconnect to the inport
* _MergeGroups_ collects grouped packets from its inports, and sends them out together once each inport has sent data with the same grouping
* _SimplifyObject_ simplifies the object structures outputted by the _CollectGroups_ component
* _CountSum_ sums together numbers received from different inports and sends the total out
* _SplitInSequence_ sends each packet to only one of its outports, going through them in sequence
* _CollectUntilIdle_ collects packets it receives, waits a given time if there are new packets, and if not, sends them out

New component libraries:

* [noflo-liquid](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-liquid) provides Liquid Templating functionality
* [noflo-markdown](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-markdown) provides Markdown conversion
* [noflo-diffbot](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-diffbot) provides access to the Diffbot screen-scraping service

## 0.2.0 (November 13th 2012)

The main change in 0.2 series was component packaging support and the fact that most component with external dependencies were moved to their own NPM packages:

* Message Queue components were moved to [noflo-mq](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-mq)
* HTML parsing components were moved to [noflo-html](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-html)
* XML parsing components were moved to [noflo-html](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-xml)
* YAML parsing components were moved to [noflo-html](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-yaml)
* Web Server components were moved to [noflo-webserver](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-webserver)
* CouchDB components were moved to [noflo-couchdb](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-couchdb)
* BaseCamp API components were moved to [noflo-basecamp](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-basecamp)
* Restful Metrics components were moved to [noflo-restfulmetrics](https://npmjs.org/package/noflo-restfulmetrics)

To use the components, install the corresponding NPM package and change the component's name in your graph to include the package namespace. For example, `yaml/ParseYaml` for the _ParseYaml_ component in the _noflo-yaml_ package

User interface:

* The `noflo` command-line tool now has a new `list` command for listing components available for a given directory, for example: `$ noflo list .`

NoFlo internals:

* New _ComponentLoader_ to support loading components and subgraphs to installed NPM modules
* NoFlo's own codebase was moved to direct requires making the NPM installation simpler
* [daemon](https://npmjs.org/package/daemon) dependency was removed from NoFlo's command-line tools

Changes to core components:

* _Merge_ only disconnects once all of its inports have disconnected
* _Concat_ only disconnects once all of its inports have disconnected
* _CompileString_'s `in` port is now an ArrayPort
* _GroupByObjectKey_ also supports boolean values for the matched keys
* _ReadDir_ disconnects after reading a directory

New core components:

* _Drop_ allows explicitly dropping packets in a graph. The component performs no operations on the data it receives
